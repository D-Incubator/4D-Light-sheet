# 4D-Light-sheet
4D image reconstruction and VR model generation for the paper "4D Light-Sheet Imaging and Interactive Analysis of Cardiac Contractility in Zebrafish Larvae".

## This package contains:
1. The MATLAB code for reconstructing 4D images using parallel computation.
2. The python code for converting .tif images with mutiple cell labels into .obj files for VR analysis in Unity.

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Python 3
- 3D Slicer

## Usage
### Run the 4D reconstruction code 
0. The platform is MATLAB(R). [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) is required for parallel computation.
1. Download the [4D-Reconstruction] code in the repository.
2. Download the example dataset via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6wrtxzxBQMfubPJYMH8rC0Q6WtakY-p/view?usp=share_link) on google drive and put the data in '4D-Reconstruction/example'.
